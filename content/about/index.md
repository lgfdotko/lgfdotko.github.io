Hello! My name is Guofeng Li,
I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in computer architecture at 
Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS), 
advised by Prof. Ninghui Sun and Prof. Mingyu Chen.

My research focuses on hardware-assisted memory safety, secure hardware design
and heterogeneous computing. My technical work involves developing Linux kernel drivers and FPGA prototypes, with hands-on experience implementing PCIe, AXI, and NVMe solutions through hw-sw co-design.

​​​I welcome discussions with researchers working on related topics — feel free to reach out for potential collaborations in computer architecture and systems!
Please contact me at liguofeng22s[at]ict[dot]ac[dot]cn.
